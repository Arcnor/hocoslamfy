== Playing the game ==

- The aim of the game -
The aim of Commuslamfy is to steer your character, Captain Communist (a red plastic bag with the communist logo on it), in the space between columns made of dollar bills: one that ascends from the ground, and one that descends from the sky (don't ask why - game logic).

One point is awarded per column of dollar bills after you successfully steer Captain Communist into its space. The game ends when Captain Communist crashes into a dollar bill or you fly into the upper or lower edge of the screen, respectively getting polluted by the clouds of soot or becoming unable to fly due to being stuck on the ground.

After a game ends, your high score is updated and kept in a file. See the 'Files' section for more information.

- Controls -
To start a game from either the title screen or the score screen, press Start or A.

In-game, any face button (A, B, X and Y) allows you to make Captain Communist fly upwards. He is pulled down by gravity.

In-game, Start allows you to pause and resume the game. Captain Communist's momentum from before pausing applies when resuming.

To exit Commuslamfy from any screen, press Select. In the title screen or the score screen, you can also press B to exit.

To avoid starting new games or exiting Commuslamfy immediately after a death, it is recommended to use the X and Y face buttons. Of course, you can use any button you wish.
